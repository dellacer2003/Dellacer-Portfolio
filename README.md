# Dellacer-Portfolio
Portfolio website of Dellacer a.k.a Nguyen Dang Khoa
In this website, I would like to show you some of my projects, using Excel, Power BI, Python and PostgreSQL. All of these are my self-learn project, however, the Python project is my course work in my university. My team worked on it together, and I was aminly responsible for the code and some of information research on related stocks.
